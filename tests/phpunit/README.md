# Overview

This directory stores files related to PHPUnit test.

## Usage

In order to run PHPUnit tests, you will need to run PHPUnit from the project root directory and simple enter `phpunit`. If you need to run an individual test, use the following syntax:

```
phpunit code/features/examplefeature/tests/UnitTest.php
```

phpunit.xml has been configured to output an HTML coverage report to results/coverage as well as outputting the results to stdout.
