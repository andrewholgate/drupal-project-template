 *
 * This file will be automatically included in the project if it is copied to
 * sites/default/settings.local.php, as settings.php contains the following
 * logic:
 *
 * if (file_exists(dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.local.php')) {
 *  require_once(dirname(__FILE__) .'/settings.local.php');
 * }
 *
 *
 * Note: This file should be copied outside of the project folder and renamed
 * to settings.local.php for it to be included in the staging environment.
 * This file should not be kept under revision control.
